/*
 * PATCHes
 *
 * Only put here ADDED special stuff, for instance: ".mu3" or ".ban"
 * Please start the patchlevel with a '.'
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Since u2.9 there is a new format of this file. The reason
 * is that this way it shouldn't be needed anymore for the user to edit
 * this manually !!!
 * If you do, be sure you know what you are doing!
 *
 * For patch devellopers:
 * To make a diff of your patch, edit any of the below lines containing
 * a "" (an EMPTY string). Your patch will then succeed, with only an
 * offset, on the first empty place in the users patchlevel.h.
 * Do not change anyother line, the '\' are to make sure that the 'fuzz'
 * will stay 0. --Run
