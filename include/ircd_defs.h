 *
 * The domain name space is a tree structure.  Each node and leaf on the
 * tree corresponds to a resource set (which may be empty).  The domain
 * system makes no distinctions between the uses of the interior nodes and
 * leaves, and this memo uses the term "node" to refer to both.
 *
 * Each node has a label, which is zero to 63 octets in length.  Brother
 * nodes may not have the same label, although the same label can be used
 * for nodes which are not brothers.  One label is reserved, and that is
 * the null (i.e., zero length) label used for the root.
 *
 * This has proven not to be a problem in the past as connections with FQDN's
 * of greater than 63 characters are rejected by the server, and most FQDN's
 * are shorter. It is possible to have a valid FQDN longer than 63 characters.
