SNOMASK - Server Notice Masks
Written by Ghostwolf 18th June 1997
Modified with permission by loki 12th November 1997

This document (hopefully) gives a brief explanation of the use of server
notice masks. This mask allows clients to specify which types of server
notices they will receive when usermode +s. 
The mask may optionally be omitted, and reasonable defaults will be used
by the server.

Note: the descriptions here will be best understood by those with knowledge
of C syntax. We do not attempt to explain either this or hexadecimal values
in this document, and familiarity with these is assumed of the reader.

    Usage: /mode <nick> +s [+/-][mask]

  Mask 	  	Hex value 	Description
    1 		SNO_OLDSNO 	0x1 	/* unsorted old messages */
    2 		SNO_SERVKILL 	0x2 	/* server kills (nick collisions) */
    4 		SNO_OPERKILL 	0x4 	/* oper kills */
    8 		SNO_HACK2 	0x8 	/* desyncs */
    16 		SNO_HACK3 	0x10 	/* temporary desyncs */
    32 		SNO_UNAUTH 	0x20 	/* unauthorized connections */
    64 		SNO_TCPCOMMON 	0x40 	/* common TCP or socket errors */
    128 	SNO_TOOMANY 	0x80 	/* too many connections */
    256 	SNO_HACK4 	0x100 	/* Uworld actions on channels */
    512 	SNO_GLINE 	0x200 	/* glines */
    1024 	SNO_NETWORK 	0x400 	/* net join/break, etc */
    2048 	SNO_IPMISMATCH 	0x800 	/* IP mismatches */
    4096 	SNO_THROTTLE 	0x1000 	/* host throttle add/remove notices */
    8192 	SNO_OLDREALOP 	0x2000 	/* old oper-only messages */
    16384 	SNO_CONNEXIT 	0x4000 	/* client connect/exit (ugh) */
    32768	SNO_AUTO	0x8000  /* AUTO G-Lines */
    65536	SNO_DEBUG	0x10000 /* debugging messages (DEBUGMODE only) */

    standard +s 		SNO_DEFAULT (SNO_NETWORK | SNO_OPERKILL | SNO_GLINE)
    standard +s when +o/O 	SNO_DEFAULT | SNO_HACK2 | SNO_HACK4 | SNO_THROTTLE | SNO_OLDSNO)
    only opers may set 		SNO_OPER (SNO_CONNEXIT | SNO_OLDREALOP)


Examples of Usage

    To receive only operkills, use /mode +s 4
    To receive operkills and glines, add the values:

        /mode <nick> +s 516

        (512+4=516) 

    If you are already receiving some notices and you wish to add notices of
    netjoins/breaks use:

        /mode Ghostwolf +s +1024

    If you wish to stop receiving netjoin/break notices, but continue to receive
    other notices, use:

        /mode Ghostwolf +s -1024
        OR
        /mode Ghostwolf -s +1024 

    A user typing /mode Ghostwolf +s will receive netsplits/joins, operkills,
    and g-lines.


Opers who are +s will additionally receive HACK notices and anything that was
originally in sendto_ops() and wasn't changed. Only opers can choose to receive
connect/exit notices and anything that originally was in sendtoreal_ops() and
hasn't been changed (connect/exit notices also require a #define in config.h).
