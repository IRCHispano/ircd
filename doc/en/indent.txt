If you want to indent this source file, in order to convert
the source tree to the used programming style, you should use
`make indent' in the base directory.

For this to work you need to have `indent' version 2.2.10 or higher
in your PATH.  GNU indent 2.2.10 is available from all GNU sites,
its main ftp site is ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/indent/.  Or you can
download it directly from the webpage of its maintainer at
http://www.xs4all.nl/~carlo17/indent/
