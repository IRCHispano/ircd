/**
 * @file
 * @brief Core password encryption routines.
 * @version $Id: ircd_crypt.c,v 1.8 2007-09-20 21:00:31 zolty Exp $
 *
 * This is a new look crypto API for ircu, it can handle different
 * password formats by the grace of magic tokens at the beginning of the
 * password e.g. $SMD5 for Salted MD5, $CRYPT for native crypt(), etc.
 *
 * Currently crypt routines are implemented for: the native crypt()
 * function, Salted MD5 and a plain text mechanism which should only
 * be used for testing.  I intend to add Blowfish, 3DES and possibly
 * SHA1 support as well at some point, but I'll need to check the
 * possible problems that'll cause with stupid crypto laws.
 *
 * It's also designed to be "ready" for the modularisation of ircu, so
 * someone get round to doing it, because I'm not doing it ;)
 *
 * The plan for Stage B is to semi-modularise the authentication
 * mechanism to allow authentication against some other sources than
 * the conf file (whatever takes someones fancy, kerberos, ldap, sql, etc).
 *
 *                   -- blessed be, hikari.
