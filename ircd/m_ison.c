/** Handle an ISON request from a local connection.

 * \a parv has the following elements:
 * \li \a parv[1] is the comma-separated list of nicknames to check
 *
 * Added by Darren Reed 13/8/91 to act as an efficient user indicator
 * with respect to cpu/bandwidth used. Implemented for NOTIFY feature in
 * clients. Designed to reduce number of whois requests. Can process
 * nicknames in batches as long as the maximum buffer length.
 *
 * format:
 * ISON :nicklist
 *
 * XXX - this is virtually the same as send_user_info, but doesn't send
 * no nick found, might be refactored so that m_userhost, m_userip, and
 * m_ison all use the same function with different formatters. --Bleep
 *
 * See @ref m_functions for discussion of the arguments.
 * @param[in] cptr Client that sent us the message.
 * @param[in] sptr Original source of message.
 * @param[in] parc Number of arguments.
 * @param[in] parv Argument vector.
