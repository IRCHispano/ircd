 * We need a new function `mmatch(const char *old_mask, const char *new_mask)'
 * which returns `true' likewise the current `match' (start with copying it),
 * but which treats '*' and '?' in `new_mask' differently (not "\*" and "\?" !)
 * as follows:  a '*' in `new_mask' does not match a '?' in `old_mask' and
 * a '?' in `new_mask' does not match a '\?' in `old_mask'.
 * And ofcourse... a '*' in `new_mask' does not match a '\*' in `old_mask'...
 * And last but not least, '\?' and '\*' in `new_mask' now become one character.

/*
 ***************** Nemesi's matchcomp() / matchexec() **************
 */

/* These functions allow the use of "compiled" masks, you compile a mask
 * by means of matchcomp() that gets the plain text mask as input and writes
 * its result in the memory locations addressed by the 3 parameters:
 * - *cmask will contain the text of the compiled mask
 * - *minlen will contain the lenght of the shortest string that can match 
 *   the mask
 * - *charset will contain the minimal set of chars needed to match the mask
 * You can pass NULL as *charset and it will be simply not returned, but you
 * MUST pass valid pointers for *minlen and *cmask (wich must be big enough 
 * to contain the compiled mask text that is in the worst case as long as the 
 * text of the mask itself in plaintext format) and the return value of 
 * matchcomp() will be the number of chars actually written there (excluded 
 * the trailing zero). cmask can be == mask, matchcomp() can work in place.
 * The {cmask, minlen} couple of values make the real compiled mask and
 * need to be passed to the functions that use the compiled mask, if you pass
 * the wrong minlen or something wrong in cmask to one of these expect a
 * coredump. This means that when you record a compiled mask you must store
 * *both* these values.
 * Once compiled the mask can be used to match a string by means of 
 * matchexec(), it can be printed back to human-readable format by means
 * of sprintmatch() or it can be compared to another compiled mask by means
 * of mmexec() that will tell if it completely overrides that mask (a lot like
 * what mmatch() does for plain text masks).
 * You can gain a lot of speed in many situations avoiding to matchexec() when:
 * - The maximum lenght of the field you are about to match() the mask to is
 *   shorter than minlen, in example when matching abc*def*ghil with a nick:
 *   It just cannot match since a nick is at most 9 chars long and the mask
 *   needs at least 10 chars (10 will be the value returned in minlen).
 * - The charset allowed for the field you are about to match to doesn't
 *   "contain" the charset returned by matchcomp(), in example when you
 *   have *.* as mask it makes no sense to try to match it against a nick
 *   because, again, a nick can't contain a '.', you can check this with
 *   a simple (charset & NTL_IRCNK) in this case.
 * - As a special case, since compiled masks are forced to lowercase,
 *   it would make no sense to use the NTL_LOWER and NTL_UPPER on a compiled
 *   mask, thus they are reused as follows: if the NTL_LOWER bit of charset
 *   is set it means that the mask contains only non-wilds chars (i.e. you can
 *   use strCasecmp() to match it or a direct hash lookup), if the NTL_UPPER
 *   bit is set it means that it contains only wild chars (and you can
 *   match it with strlen(field)>=minlen).
 * Do these optimizations ONLY when the data you are about to pass to
 * matchexec() are *known* to be invalid in advance, using strChattr() 
 * or strlen() on the text would be slower than calling matchexec() directly
 * and let it fail.
 * Internally a compiled mask contain in the *cmask area the text of
 * the plain text form of the mask itself with applied the following hacks:
 * - All characters are forced to lowercase (so that uppercase letters and
 *   specifically the symbols 'A' and 'Z' are reserved for special use)
 * - All non-escaped stars '*' are replaced by the letter 'Z'
 * - All non-escaped question marks '?' are replaced by the letter 'A' 
 * - All escape characters are removed, the wilds escaped by them are
 *   then passed by without the escape since they don't collide anymore
 *   with the real wilds (encoded as A/Z) 
 * - Finally the part of the mask that follows the last asterisk is
 *   reversed (byte order mirroring) and moved right after the first
 *   asterisk.
 * After all this a mask like:   Head*CHUNK1*chu\*nK2*ch??k3*TaIl 
 *               .... becomes:   headZliatZchunk1Zchu*nk2ZchAAk3
 * This can still be printed on a console, more or less understood by an
 * human and handled with the usual str*() library functions.
 * When you store somewhere the compiled mask you can avoid storing the
 * textform of it since it can be "decompiled" by means of sprintmatch(),
 * but at that time the following things are changed in the mask:
 * - All chars have been forced to lowercase.
 * - The mask is collapsed.
 * The balance point of using compiled masks in terms of CPU is when you expect
 * to use matchexec() instead of match() at least 20 times on the same mask
 * or when you expect to use mmexec() instead of mmatch() 3 times.

/*
 * matchcompIP()
 * Compiles an IP mask into an in_mask structure
 * The given <mask> can either be:
 * - An usual irc type mask, containing * and or ?
 * - An ip number plus a /bitnumber part, that will only consider
 *   the first "bitnumber" bits of the IP (bitnumber must be in 0-31 range)
 * - An ip numer plus a /ip.bit.mask.values that will consider
 *   only the bits marked as 1 in the ip.bit.mask.values
 * In the last two cases both the ip number and the bitmask can specify
 * less than 4 bytes, the missing bytes then default to zero, note that
 * this is *different* from the way inet_aton() does and that this does
 * NOT happen for normal IPmasks (not containing '/')
 * If the returned value is zero the produced in_mask might match some IP,
 * if it's nonzero it will never match anything (and the imask struct is
 * set so that always fails).
 *
 * The returned structure contains 3 fields whose meaning is the following:
 * im.mask = The bits considered significative in the IP
 * im.bits = What these bits should look like to have a match
 * im.fall = If zero means that the above information used as 
 *           ((IP & im.mask) == im.bits) is enough to tell if the compiled
 *           mask matches the given IP, nonzero means that it is needed,
 *           in case they did match, to call also the usual text match
 *           functions, because the mask wasn't "completely compiled"
 *
 * They should be used like:
 * matchcompIP(&im, mask);
 * if ( ((IP & im.mask)!=im.bits)) || (im.fall&&match(mask,inet_ntoa(IP))) )
 *    { handle_non_match } else { handle_match };
 * instead of:
 * if ( match(mask, inet_ntoa(IP)) )
 *    { handle_non_match } else { handle_match };
 * 
 * Note: This function could be smarter when dealing with complex masks,
 *       this implementation is quite lazy and understands only very simple
 *       cases, whatever contains a ? anywhere or contains a '*' that isn't
 *       part of a trailing '.*' will fallback to text-match, this could be 
 *       avoided for masks like 12?3.5.6 12.*.3.4 1.*.*.2 72?72?72?72 and
 *       so on that "could" be completely compiled to IP masks.
 *       If you try to improve this be aware of the fact that ? and *
 *       could match both dots and digits and we _must_ always reject
 *       what doesn't match in textform (like leading zeros and so on),
 *       so it's a LOT more tricky than it might seem. By now most common
 *       cases are optimized.
