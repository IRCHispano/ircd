/** @file
 * @brief Manipulation functions for the whowas list.
 * @version $Id$
 *
 * Since the introduction of numeric nicks (at least for upstream messages,
 * like MODE +o \<nick\>, KICK \#chan \<nick\>, KILL \<nick\> etc), there is no
 * real important reason for a nick history anymore.
 * Nevertheless, there are two reason why we might want to keep it:
 * @li The /WHOWAS command, which is often useful to catch harassing
 *    users or abusers in general.
 * @li Clients still use the normal nicks in the client-server protocol,
 *    and it might be considered a nice feature that here we still have
 *    nick chasing.
 *
 * Note however that BOTH reasons make it redundant to keep a whowas history
 * for users that split off.
 *
 * The rewrite of comstud was many to safe cpu during net.breaks and therefore
 * a bit redundant imho (Run).
 *
 * But - it was written anyway.  So lets look at the structure of the
 * whowas history now:
 *
 * We still have a static table of 'struct Whowas' structures in which we add
 * new nicks (plus info) as in a rotating buffer.  We keep a global pointer
 * `whowas_next' that points to the next entry to be overwritten - or to
 * the oldest entry in the table (which is the same).
 *
 * Each entry keeps pointers for two doubly linked lists (thus four pointers):
 * A list of the entries that have the same hash value ('hashv list'), and
 * a list of the entries that have the same online pointer (`online list').
 * Note that the last list (pointers) is only updated as long as online points
 * to the corresponding client: As soon as the client signs off, this list
 * is not anymore maintained (and hopefully not used anymore either ;).
 *
 * So now we have two ways of accessing this database:
 * @li Given a \<nick\> we can calculate a hashv and then whowashash[hashv] will
 *    point to the start of the 'hash list': all entries with the same hashv.
 *    We'll have to search this list to find the entry with the correct \<nick\>.
 *    Once we found the correct whowas entry, we have a pointer to the
 *    corresponding client - if still online - for nick chasing purposes.
 *    Note that the same nick can occur multiple times in the whowas history,
 *    each of these having the same hash value of course.  While a /WHOWAS on
 *    just a nick will return all entries, nick chasing will only find the
 *    first in the list.  Because new entries are added at the start of the
 *    'hash list' we will always find the youngest entry, which is what we want.
 * @li Given an online client we have a pointer to the first whowas entry
 *    of the linked list of whowas entries that all belong to this client.
 *    We ONLY need this to reset all `online' pointers when this client
 *    signs off.
 *
 * 27/8/97:
 *
 * Note that following:
 *
 * @li We *only* (need to) change the 'hash list' and the 'online' list
 *    in add_history().
 * @li There we always ADD an entry to the BEGINNING of the 'hash list'
 *    and the 'online list': *new* entries are at the start of the lists.
 *    The oldest entries are at the end of the lists.
 * @li We always REMOVE the oldest entry we have (whowas_next), this means
 *    that this is always an entry that is at the *end* of the 'hash list'
 *    and 'online list' that it is a part of: the next pointer will
 *    always be NULL.
 * @li The previous pointer is *only* used to update the next pointer of the
 *    previous entry, therefore we could better use a pointer to this
 *    next pointer: That is faster - saves us a 'if' test (it will never be
 *    NULL because the last added entry will point to the pointer that
 *    points to the start of the list) and we won't need special code to
 *    update the list start pointers.
 *
 * I incorporated these considerations into the code below.
