 * ircd_crypt_smd5 is largely taken from md5_crypt.c from the Linux PAM
 * source code.  it's been modified to fit in with ircu and some of the
 * unneeded code has been removed.  the source file md5_crypt.c has the
 * following license, so if any of our opers or admins are in Denmark
 * they better go buy them a drink ;) -- hikari
